# BCHPAY POS

For those wanting to demo this, this was made for tablets and mobile phone resolutions as the frontend will be ported to it's own wallet app at some point in the future. It does work fine on desktop as well, but that is not something that was heavily focused on when making this.

Check out a [vertical video of the app in action here](https://streamable.com/44dcv).

## Features

* Receive tokens or BCH with **visually instant** payment notifications regardless of slow SLPDB validation times.
* All external requests go via SLPDB & BitDB fountainhead which means no to minimal tracking and a proven 99.97% uptime.
* Requires no trust in the shop keeper or employee, transactions go straight to the owner's personal wallet.
* Very light-weight and sports a UI that has good contrast even in lighter areas such as a market stand or overly-lit resturants.
* (SOON) The merchant can easily attach a note to a transaction on the "payment confirmed" screen or later on in the history tab.
* Minimal-bullshit user-interface. Enter your details once and after that all your employees have to worry about is entering the correct amount.
* Only accept tokens you want to accept. Search and select the ones you really want to use on initial setup and never worry about it again.
* Invoices expire after 10 minutes to conserve battery life and to avoid merchants showing the wrong invoice to the next customer if the last one was left unpaid.
